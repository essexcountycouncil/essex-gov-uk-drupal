# Contributing&#10&#10## Environments&#10&#10### Production&#10https://essex.gov.uk&#10&#10Only the _main_ branch can be deployed.&#10&#10### Preprod&#10Currently used for multiple, conflicting purposes:&#10* Creating new content, prior to transferring it to Production&#10* Investigating new features, not yet in _develop_ branch&#10* UAT - testing by the client before deploying&#10&#10To support this, any branch can be deployed.&#10&#10New features may include new modules that are not in _develop_ branch.&#10These must be uninstalled manually before another branch is deployed to Preprod.&#10&#10### Dev&#10Used for:&#10* QA by Nomensa's testers&#10* CI/CD - merges to _develop_ will trigger a deployment to Dev environment using&#10  the Gitlab pipeline.&#10&#10## Branches&#10### _main_&#10This is the stable branch, containing the code that has been deployed to&#10Production. Its main purposes are to make it easier to:&#10* check what is on Production&#10* create hotfix branches&#10&#10### _develop_&#10This is the branch for testing features and bugfixes before being merged to &#10_main_ and deployed to Production.&#10&#10Pull requests should only be merged to _develop_ if they are ready to be tested&#10and deployed. If it is uncertain whether a new feature is required then it &#10should stay in a feature branch.&#10&#10### Release branches&#10We will try to avoid release branches by frequent testing of _develop_, merging&#10to _main_ and deployment to Production.&#10&#10### Feature and bugfix branches&#10New features and bugfixes should be branched off _develop_ and pull requests&#10created back to _develop_.&#10&#10### Hotfix branches&#10Only hotfixes (e.g. for security updates) should be branched off _main_ so they&#10can be deployed to Production ahead of features that are still being&#10tested.&#10&#10### Commits&#10Commit messages should be prefixed with a Jira ticket number so that the&#10purpose of the change can be traced.&#10&#10Multiple commits in a pull request should be squashed unless the individual&#10commit messages are informative.
